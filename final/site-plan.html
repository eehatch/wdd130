      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This webiste will be for mostly friends and family who want to see images and a brief overview of my mission. The homepage will give information about my mission as a whole. This will talk
        about statistics and the Utah Ogden Mission boundaries and such. This will show a picture of the mission, and me with my Mission Leaders.  </p> 
        <p>Some specific events I hope to include are: \n a group photo from the MTC, first picture with my first companion, 3 pictures infront of the "South Ogden" tunnel sign to show my progress as a missionary,
        Sister Powell arriving, my trio, Sister Jones, and with my Mission Leaders on my last day in the mission.

      </ul>
      <h3>Ogden!</h3>
      <p>
        Page 1 will talk about my time spent in South Ogden, both the first and second time I spent there. I want to talk about my companions
        and share the people I spent time with, while being aware of privacy. The top of the page will include a picture of the well known "Welcome to Ogden" sign. This will be the page I can talk about 3 
        of my 4 companions- and also where I both start and end my mission.

      </ul>
      <h3>Logan!</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 will talk/show my time in Logan, Utah. This page will show my growth over the 9 months I was here. I can talk about the Central and East stakes. As well as the Deaf Branch. I want to have a
        picture of driving to Tremonton to visit deaf friends. 
        During my time in Logan, I had the great opportunity to make a muisc video with Sister Maslich and the Nielsons to the youth song "Trust in the Lord", I may add the link or imbed the youtube video Into
        this site. It would either be on the home page or Page 2. In Logan I was still in training and covered 1 stake of 7 wards and 2 branches. My companion and I felt slow and our mission president decided
        to give us a second stake with 8 additional wards to cover.
