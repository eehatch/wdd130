                <p class="ogden-text1">I started and ended my mission while serving in South Ogden, and had 4 different companions during these months. On the left is the first time I met Sister Powell, my first trainee! The right is SIster Jones who I trained during my last transfer.  </p>

                <p class="ogden-text"> I trained Sister Jones during my last transfer. It was a wild 6 weeks, but exactly what I needed to end on a good note.</p>
                <p class="ogden-mid">It was a cool experience coming back to my beginning and being able to recognize my growth. I covered the Burch Creek stake here, as well as the Ogden Deaf Branch. One of my favotie parts was beign able to visit the retirement homes! I learned how to give all my time to the Lord from the members here.</p>
