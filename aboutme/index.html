        Hello!! My Name is Emily, and I am from the Seattle area, more specifically Maple Valley. I do miss the rain and prefer the cold weather
        to the warm.
    </p>
    <p>
        In May I retuned home from my mission in Ogden, Utah where I used ASL!!
        I am majoring in CIT with a minor in Technical Theatre. I love movies, and books, and listening to music! In High School I was on the dance team,
        but unfortunately that is not something I have continued doing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am willing to share contact information or work together outside of class!
